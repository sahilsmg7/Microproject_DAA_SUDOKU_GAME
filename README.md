# Mini_Project_Sudoko_Game
Solve Sudoko using Backtracing and Recursion in Python.  
It is Terminal base sudoko solver         

# What is Sudoko Game?
Sudoku is a simple number game that involves a grid of nine-by-nine boxes. 
Numbers from one to nine fill the boxes. No number can occur twice in each row and each column

# These two important methods we are going to imply are recursion and backtracking.
# Recursion
Recursion involves calling a function within a function. 
You will come to understand this when we need to call the function several times to solve an unknown number.

# Backtracking
Backtracking involves inserting a possible number in the nearest empty box and going to the next unsolved box. 
This will go on until we run into an error and we place a zero in the box. We move to the previously solved box and try the next possible number to solve it
